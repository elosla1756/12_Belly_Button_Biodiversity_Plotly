# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis


## **Overview of Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis**: in this challenge, we completed the dashboard we had created as part of the module, to add different types of charts that will automatically update once the user selects an ID number.

### We had completed the panel with the demographic information of the selected participant ID number, and created various charts that enable the users to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers are now able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. The three charts we created are:

1. Horizontal Bar Chart
2. Bubble Chart
3. Gauge Chart 

### Lastly, we customized each chart with a specific font type, background color, added a background picture in the jumbotron, and made the whole web page mobile-responsive.
